# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Surprising accurate, a lot of them were accurate to within 15 - 20 minutes with
prac 7 being the biggest deviation as I didn't expect it to be so big.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Not a noticeable amount. By the time we started doing estimates I think I had a decent grasp
on around how long it was taking me to do projects and each prac was usually doing something new (even if they included old stuff sometimes)
so there wasn't any huge time savings as we did more pracs.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I'm not super sure what I was meant to learn from doing the estimates. Sometimes when I was feeling good I would
try to race the estimate a little to see if I could finish before my estimated time but that didn't usually happen.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Mostly that it makes me happy when people give me little compliments on my code, I wish I had done this more in my own reviews for others.
It was a little hard to learn more about coding as we are all learning the same things at the same time and usually reviews came after workshops
where Lindsay had already showed me my horrendous coding errors and I learned from those instead of reviews.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

The biggest thing is literally just where on GitHUB I need to be looking to do the reviews. I have used github to copy
repos before this subject but nothing else so starting to find out about other functions of the site has been nice.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review for Lachlan Torrisi](https://github.com/Lachlan-Torrisi/cp1404practical/pull/1)

### Explanation

Primarily great because I used the taco emoji <3
I tried to focus on what Lachlan specified for feedback which I think was good. I did make a pretty big mistake of not 
specifically commenting on sections of the code and just left a singular comment which is not great, I realised this mistake after feedback in the workshop.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review for emokebohuss](https://github.com/emokebohuss/cp1404practicals/pull/6#pullrequestreview-3521254525)

### Explanation

This review was late due to my laptop breaking :(
I fixed my mistake of leaving a single comment with all the review, once again I tried to focus on specifically what they requested (SRP in taxi simulator).
I had a few other comments on the code as I initially starting going through the commits for some reason instead of the actual files.
I tried to be nice with my comments and make suggestions as to what they could change instead of demanding it be completely different.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

These were laid out incredibly well with all the necessary information for each one, I really really like this about the pracs.
I don't really think I could improve on them, I would add extension tasks that I personally like to work on
like graphics programming but that's straight up irrelevant to this subject so who knows. My favourite extension task was 
trying to get kivy apps onto my phone which took much more time than it should have so maybe more things like that?

Code reviews were my least favourite part and I would want to change them somehow but I don't know how I could improve them, I only
disliked them because of my own lack of time and after doing code for this subject and my other subjects I kinda hated the idea of
looking at even more code.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I thought that my ability to write 'good' code improved a lot, in that the idea of SRP and the use of programming patterns
has really improved the readability of my code. I definitely have lots to work on there still particulary with attention to detail
but looking at code from before I started this subject the change is pretty incredible. I managed to get pretty much every practical
at least working so if that counts I thought I did quite well.
