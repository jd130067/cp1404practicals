# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Surprising accurate, a lot of them were accurate to within 15 - 20 minutes with
prac 7 being the biggest deviation as I didn't expect it to be so big.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Not a noticeable amount. By the time we started doing estimates I think I had a decent grasp
on around how long it was taking me to do projects and each prac was usually doing something new (even if they included old stuff sometimes)
so there wasn't any huge time savings as we did more pracs.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I'm not super sure what I was meant to learn from doing the estimates. Sometimes when I was feeling good I would
try to race the estimate a little to see if I could finish before my estimated time but that didn't usually happen.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

These were laid out incredibly well with all the necessary information for each one, I really really like this about the pracs.
I don't really think I could improve on them, I would add extension tasks that I personally like to work on
like graphics programming but that's straight up irrelevant to this subject so who knows. My favourite extension task was 
trying to get kivy apps onto my phone which took much more time than it should have so maybe more things like that?

Code reviews were my least favourite part and I would want to change them somehow but I don't know how I could improve them, I only
disliked them because of my own lack of time and after doing code for this subject and my other subjects I kinda hated the idea of
looking at even more code.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I thought that my ability to write 'good' code improved a lot, in that the idea of SRP and the use of programming patterns
has really improved the readability of my code. I definitely have lots to work on there still particulary with attention to detail
but looking at code from before I started this subject the change is pretty incredible. I managed to get pretty much every practical
at least working so if that counts I thought I did quite well.
