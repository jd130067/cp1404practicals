## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Meaningful Naming:** Giving variables, functions, and classes descriptive names improves readability and maintainability.
- **SRP:* Breaking code into single-purpose functions (e.g., `add_project()`, `update_project()`, `filter_by_date()`) is not new to me but this subject is the first time I have be forced to properly think about how I handle things in my functions.
- **Workflow Setup/Usage:** Setting up IDE's sucks a lot and is a big part of why I've never gotten into python. Through this subject I've learnt a bunch about it. Also actually using GIT well is completely new to me and wonderful. I like working on home pc and laptop and it all just works.
